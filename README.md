# Nessus Vulnerability Management Homelab

In this homelab project, I will use VirtualBox to create a vulnerable Windows 10 virtual machine, which I will scan for vulnerabilities with Nessus Essentials and proceed to remediate them. This project is a showcase of the following steps of the Vulnerabilty Management Lifecycle:
- Discover
- Prioritize
- Assess
- Remediate

## Project Walk-through

### Setting up vulnerable Windows 10 VM

First priority is to download and run the Nesses Essentials installer file. It will take some time to finitish initializing, so while that is going, we can setup our Windows 10 virtual machine and configure while we wait

When setting up the Windows 10 VM, we want to configure the network adapter to be bridged, so that we can be on the same network as my host machine. This facilitates the Nessus implementation's communication with our VM.

Once the vm is setup, we'll do an initial `ping` to verify that we're able to communicate with it, but as we can see below, it looks like our ICMP packets
aren't going through.

This is most likely because the Windows 10 firewall is enabled, so let's disable it:

Now that the firewall is disabled, let's retry pinging the vm with our host machine and now we should see that we get a response from the vm.

### Configuring Nessus Essentials

By now, Nessus Essentials should be fully initialized

Launch the scan:
